## Song Recommender System

# Overview

Recommendation systems are models for information filtering that enhance the user experience by improving the quality of search results and suggesting relevant items. 
These systems are widely used in everyday applications such as streaming platforms and e-commerce websites. The goal of my project was to automate music recommendations 
by leveraging machine learning algorithms from two approaches - content-based filtering and collaborative filtering.
● Content-based filtering suggests similar items based on a particular item by analyzing metadata, but lacks a metric for predictive accuracy. 
I implemented a clustering algorithm (k-Means clustering) to build my predictive model.
● Collaborative filtering suggests items to users based on user preferences and similar user interaction. 
For this, I used the ** Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) ** algorithm, achieving a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.05.
